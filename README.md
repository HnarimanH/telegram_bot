# ü§ñ Truth or Dare Telegram Bot

A Telegram bot that brings chaotic fun to your group chats. Built with Python, `python-telegram-bot`, and a sprinkle of SQLite for storing players. It randomly selects a player and throws them a Truth or Dare question from a CSV file. Simple, stupid, and actually fun.

4. Players type `T` or `D`:
   - A **random player** is chosen.
   - A random **Truth** or **Dare** question is selected from the CSV.
5. Use `/end` to stop the game and clear all players.

## üìÅ CSV Format (`questions.csv`)

The bot uses a CSV file named `questions.csv` in the same directory, formatted like this:

| Type | questions                           |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| T    | What's your biggest fear?           |
| D    | Do 10 jumping jacks right now.      |
| T    | What's a secret you've never told?  |
| D    | Send a meme to your most recent ex. |

- `Type`: Must be either `T` (Truth) or `D` (Dare)
- `questions`: The actual question text
